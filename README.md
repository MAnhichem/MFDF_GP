# MFDF_GP
Development of a multi-fidelity data fusion approach introduced by Lam, Allaire and Willcox (2015). The framework is based on a variance-weighted combination of Gaussian Processes and is using GPflow implementation.

Simplified version of the multifidelity data fusion framework applied to aircraft wing pressure distributions in [Multifidelity Data Fusion Applied to Aircraft Wing Pressure Distribution](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2022-3526) by James Robert Lloyd, David Duvenaud, Roger Grosse, Joshua B. Tenenbaum and Zoubin Ghahramani, appearing in [AIAA Aviation Forum 2022](https://www.aiaa.org/aviation).
